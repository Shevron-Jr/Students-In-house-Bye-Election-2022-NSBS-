# Students'-In-house-Bye-Election-2022-NSBS
### INTRODUCTION üìï 
The nomination list of students running for positions in the Department association under the legislative council is the subject of this analysis.
The Student Legislative Council (SLC) is represented. To effectively screen candidates, the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, and Clerk must go through this analysis.
### PROBLEM STATEMENT ‚ÅâÔ∏è
Election manipulation and screening concerns have been a problem for the BS department when compiling candidate forms. This would always lead to conflicts between the legislative branch and the students.
The goal of this study is to successfully analyze this form and analytically eliminate incompetent candidates who filled out the form incorrectly. The department will verify the information provided by candidates together with their academic records.
### DATA SOURCE üîé
This data was generated directly by me using the google form, I created the form , accepted, and collated the responses to an excel file.
### DATA CLEANING / TRANSFORMATION üõÅ
Google form do automatically turn responses to excel file, but hands still needs to work on the data to look properly cleansed. I made use of google sheet for my data cleanup.
I transformed the data into a cleaned one, I ensured I kept respondents information private by not revealing their cell number, and matriculation number.
The cleaned data can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/134OgnPU8kvv6gmI2468_cs_WrQUXOvgF/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111812501831188990191&rtpof=true&sd=true)

### DATA VISUALIZATION üìä
I used Tableau desktop for the Visualization. This is my first time creating a visual.
### ANALYSIS üìàüìâ
Interact with the dashboard [hear](https://public.tableau.com/views/NSBSReport/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
![NSBS dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101089830/181726420-56bed7ee-c1a1-4d22-b0ad-37dbd68a63d8.jpg)
This visual, shows there were 5 males and 3 females who filled the form for the Student Legislative Council (SLC). This shows the strong interest of female representations in the house.
There were four level of classes which includes; 100, 200, 300 & 400 level students all from the NSBS department. Most candidates came from 300 level, having a total of  4 candidates, followed by 100 level having two candidates, then 200 level and 300 level having one (1) candidate each.
There are three (3) numbers of post being vied for; "Honourable, Assistant general secretary, and the student legislative council". Out of the eight(8) forms, six(6) candidates went for the "Honourable" postion, one (1) candidate went for Assistant general secretary, while the last one (1) candidate went for the SLC position.
Due to the previous position being held, only three (3) candidates previously held a position in the house, making them not new in house.
The CGPA rankings shows three candidates were not having a CGPA which is not supposed to be, this would be sorted out in the findings. Only three candidates are up to 4.00 CGPA and above.
### FINDINGS üîç
It was noted that majority of 300 level students are interested in the SLC in house election, and the new comers (100 Level) are gaining interest to fight their way in to the house.
While collating results, three (3) of the candidates didn‚Äôt supply their CGPA, two from 100 level and one from 300 level. They are to be disqualified, but only the 300 Level candidate would be disqualified as she already used 2 years in school and had a CGPA already, while the remianing 100 level students would be left in the elction process are they are freshers in school, who haven't participated in any examination.
It was noted that only males have previously held a position prior to this upcoming election, and this analysis is showing the great interest of females in the legistaltive house.
Only candidates with a CGPA of 3.50 and above has upper hand over other lower CGPA, as the 3.50 indicates the start of a second class upper division to a first class divission in their academics. 
### RECOMMENDATIONS üìù
I can highly contribute that Afinah T. H. of 300 level should be disqualified as she doesn‚Äôt meet the requirement of submitting her CGPA for screening.
The male who have previously handled a position in the house are to be asked about what they have contributed to the past association and how they plan on improving if they emerge.
Sulaimon A. O. of 300 level with CGPA of 3.38 wouldn‚Äôt be given much priority, and also the 100 level students Zikrullah Z. A. and Oladipupo I. A. Wouldn‚Äôt be given much priority due to their first time of being a student.


This is my first GitHub respository and my first visualization after completing my Google Data Analytics professional certificate.
I stand to be corrected for continual improvement in my upcoming works.
