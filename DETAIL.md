# Students-In-house-Bye-Election-2022-NSBS
## INTRODUCTION
The nomination list of students running for positions in the Department association under the legislative council is the subject of this analysis.
The Student Legislative Council (SLC) is represented. To effectively screen candidates, the Speaker, Deputy Speaker, and Clerk must go through this analysis.
## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Election manipulation and screening concerns have been a problem for the BS department when compiling candidate forms. This would always lead to conflicts between the legislative branch and the students.
The goal of this study is to successfully analyze this form and analytically eliminate incompetent candidates who filled out the form incorrectly. The department will verify the information provided by candidates together with their academic records.
